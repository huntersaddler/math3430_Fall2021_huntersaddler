My previous answer to this question was to build a chemical equation balancing calculator,
but I was more thinking within the scope of this class. Along with continuing to become 
more proficient in python (and maybe a little R), I would like to learn a bit about SQL. 
Since I run every day conneceted up to a gps watch with a heart monitor, I would like to 
create a database of my times, pace, route, and heart rate in which I could look at my 
performance over whatever time interval I want or what route I took. Maybe weather data
time of day could be included somehow. I will probably try to work on some useful version
of this idea to get me started on with learning more about databases.
