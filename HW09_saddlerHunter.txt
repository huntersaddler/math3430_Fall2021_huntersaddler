Floating point has a few advantages over fixed point. The biggest advantage
for floating point is that it can represent a much wider range of values
compared to fixed point. This is becuase the amount of numbers after the 
decimal is not fixed like with fixed point representation. Instead, the
the amount of numbers after the decimal can change depending on the significant
figures of the number. This allows floating point to represent very small
and very large numbers better than fixed point. For disadvantages, floating point
takes more bits to store the numbers compared to fixed point. This extra storage
causes floating point to be slower with calculations compared to fixed point.
